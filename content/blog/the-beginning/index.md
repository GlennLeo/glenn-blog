# Intro
  (Yes, there is always an intro. You should never miss it).

  It's 28 (Lunar calendar) and Tet is just two days away. 500 friends of him are at home. Some doing housework, some hanging out with others. 50 colleagues of him are also at home. Some is wrapping "b√°nh ch∆∞ng", taking a pic and posting on skype.

  In a different world, there is a guy still sitting at Highland coffee and waiting 3 hours to get on a train to come home. He doesn't know what to do and he feels bored. Then he thinks that it should be fun if he writes blogs. And he starts writing.

# Hello Friends

  Creating a blog was actually dawned on him a year ago but all the shits kept happening in his life and he just didn't have time to do it (or he forgot). Now shit still happens but he doesn't want to procrastinate any longer and decides to create this blog despite having no idea what he should write about.

## Why Glenn?

  It's a long story. In 2017, he went to New Zealand to attend a masters program at Canterbury University (sadly 4 months later he dropped out and came back to Viet Nam to pursue another road). There, he found that many of my peers have their unique English name and he thought that it would be cool if he had one too. At first, he introduced himself as "Jim" because he had listened to Jim Rohn's talks a lot. That name didn't last long though. After a few days, he realized that "Jim" has nothing to do with his name so he tried to find another one. In an afternoon after attending two lessons in school, he stayed in my room watching a new episode of "The Walking Dead" as usual. While reading subtitles, he saw this word on the screen: "Glenn" (which is a character's name) and he knew immediately that it includes every letter in his name (G for Giap, le for Le, nn for Ngoc). Glenn became his English name (and tons of other things like this blog) ever since.
  (Sadly, in the series, Glenn is pronounced as "G·ªù Len" but in NZ, they pronounce "G·ªù Lin" which makes him think of "c·ªù l·ªù" (Clean - c·ªù lin) and he doesn't like that at all. However, he still uses that name as he can't think of any name better)

## What is this blog about?

  Honestly, he has no idea for now. Every day he has thousands of thoughts that keep running around in his head and he doesn't know how to express them out. As many introverts in the world, they are not good at expressing ourselves by word and better by text. So he thinks this blog should be a place for him to write all his thoughts down and help him find a way to organize them. Sometimes he might write about programming and will be likely to write in English as a way to learn and practice those skills (as you see there are a lot of grammar and spelling errors in this blog üòû, he said that he will appreciate it if you point out those for him). Anyway, that's all he wants to say in his first blog. Thank you for reading all of this üòÑ.

  Have a nice Tet!
