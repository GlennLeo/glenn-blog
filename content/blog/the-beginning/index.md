# Hello Friends

  Creating a blog was actually dawned on me a year ago but all the shits kept happening in my life and I just didn't have time to do it. Now shit still happens but I don't want to procrastinate any longer and decide to create this blog despite having no idea what I should write about.

## Why Glenn?

  It's a long story. In 2017, I went to New Zealand to attend a masters program at Cantebury University (sadly 5 months later I dropped out and came back to Viet Nam to pursue a web and app development career). There, I found that many of my peers have their unique English name and I thought that it would be cool if I had one too. At first, I introduced myself as "Jim" because I listened to Jim Rohn's talks a lot. That name didn't last long though. After a few days, I realized that "Jim" has nothing to do with my name so I tried to find another one. In an afternoon after attending two lessons in school, I stayed in my room watching a new episode of "The Walking Dead" as usual. While reading subtitles, I saw this word on the screen: "Glenn" (which is a character's name) and I knew immediately that it includes every letter in my name (G for Giap, le for Le, nn for Ngoc). Glenn became my English name (and tons of other things like this blog) ever since.
  (Sadly, in the series, Glenn is pronounced as "G·ªù Len" but in NZ, they pronounce "G·ªù Lin" which makes me think of "c·ªù l·ªù" (Clean - c·ªù lin) and I don't like that at all. However, I still use that name as I can't think of any name better)

## What is this blog about?

  Honestly, I have no idea for now. Every day I have thousands of thoughts that keep running around in my head and I don't know how to express them out. As many introverts in the world, we are not good at expressing ourselves by word and better by text. So I guess I will use it to write about my thoughts and learn a way to organize them properly. Sometimes I might write about programming and I will be likely to write in English as a way to learn more (as you see there are a lot of grammar and spelling errors in this blog üòû, I will appreciate if you point out those for me). Anyway, That's all I want to say in my first Blog. Thank you for reading all of this üòÑ.

  Have a nice day!
