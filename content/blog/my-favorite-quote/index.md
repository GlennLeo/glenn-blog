This great advice is from a great man, Jim Rohn. It helps my life much easier when I have to make a decision with hundreds of voices around me.

    Don't be a follower, be a student.
    Take advice, but not order.
    Take information, but don't let somebody order your life.
    Make sure what you do is the product of your own conclusion.
    Not to do someone else says.
    Take what someone else says, processes, think about it, ponder it. If it makes you wonder, makes you think, then it's valuable.
    Make sure the action is the product of your own conclusion.
